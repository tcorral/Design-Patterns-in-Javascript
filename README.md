# Design Patterns in Javascript ES6
This will be a repository of how to use the Design Patterns from *Gang of Four* in your applications with Javascript.

## Update:
- Added Flyweight implementation.
- Added Bridge implementation.
- Added Prototype and Builder implementations.
- All the Design Patterns have been refactored to ES6.
- Added the Multi-Inheritance Design Patterns exclusive for ES6.
- Added new Design Patterns exclusive from Javascript.
- Added changes to index.html. Now you can check the code to be executed and the execution without open the console. Thanks -adamnbowen-

This repository contains a folder by each design pattern.

Inside these folders you can found, in some of them, other folders with numbers. This folders are the different steps to follow to arrive to the final resolution of the problem.
You will understand it better if you have one copy of the book I recommended you before.

## To transpile the code to ES5 you should execute ```gulp```
