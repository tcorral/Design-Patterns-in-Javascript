# Design Patterns in Javascript ES6
This will be a repository of how to use the Design Patterns from *Gang of Four* in your applications with Javascript.

## Update:
- Added Flyweight implementation.
- Added Bridge implementation.
- Added Prototype and Builder implementations.
- All the Design Patterns have been refactored to ES6.
- Added the Multi-Inheritance Design Patterns exclusive for ES6.
- Added new Design Patterns exclusive from Javascript.
- Added changes to index.html. Now you can check the code to be executed and the execution without open the console. Thanks -adamnbowen-
