# Design Patterns in Javascript ES6
This will be a repository of how to use the Design Patterns from *Gang of Four* in your applications with Javascript.

## Update:
- Added Flyweight implementation.
- Added Bridge implementation.
- Added Prototype and Builder implementations.
- All the Design Patterns have been refactored to ES6.
- Added the Multi-Inheritance Design Patterns exclusive for ES6.
- Added new Design Patterns exclusive from Javascript.
- Added changes to index.html. Now you can check the code to be executed and the execution without open the console. Thanks -adamnbowen-

This repository contains a folder by each design pattern.

Inside these folders you can found, in some of them, other folders with numbers . This folders are the different steps to follow to arrive to the final resolution of the problem.
You will understand it better if you have one copy of the book I recomend you before.

## To transpile the code to ES5 you should execute ```gulp```

## Setup
Recommend env: `node 11.15.0`, other node version maybe cause some build errors

```shell
npm i

gulp
```

Open the html file in each folder
